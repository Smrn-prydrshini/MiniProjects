# 🧠 DIP Project – Image Enhancement & Filtering

This project is part of my **Digital Image Processing** coursework. It demonstrates basic image enhancement techniques using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Flask**, including grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, and filtering operations like Gaussian and Median blur.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to allow users to upload an image through a web interface and apply various enhancement and filtering operations. It showcases practical implementation of DIP concepts using a browser-based interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Flask  
- OpenCV (cv2)  
- HTML  
- CSS

## ✨ Features Implemented

- 📷 Upload an image through a web interface  
- 🎨 Convert to grayscale  
- 📈 Apply histogram equalization  
- 🌫️ Gaussian and median filtering  
- 🖼️ Display the processed image in the browser

## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

### 🔧 Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Smrn-prydrshini/MiniProjects.git
cd MiniProjects/DIP\ Project
```

### 🧪 Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install flask opencv-python
```

### 🖥️ Step 3: Run the Flask App
```bash
python app.py
```

### 🌐 Step 4: Open in Browser  
Go to: `http://localhost:5000`  
Upload an image and see the result.
